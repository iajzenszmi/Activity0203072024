9. Cryptography Notice. The following packages are included in t
he Distribution that relate to cryptography:
   1. OpenSSL. The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to 
develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured and Open Sourc
e toolkit implementing the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Se
cure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols as well as a full strength ge
neral purpose cryptography library.
   2. PyCrypto. A collection of both secure hash functions (such
 as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AE
S, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.).
   3. Pycryptodome. A fork of PyCrypto. It is a self-contained P
ython package of low-level cryptographic primitives.
   4. Pycryptodomex. A stand-alone version of Pycryptodome.
   5. PyOpenSSL. A thin Python wrapper around (a subset of) the 
OpenSSL library.
   6. Kerberos (krb5, non-Windows platforms). A network authenti
cation protocol designed to provide strong authentication for cl
ient/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.
   7. Libsodium. A software library for encryption, decryption, 
signatures, password hashing and more.
   8. Pynacl. A Python binding to the Networking and Cryptograph
y library, a crypto library with the stated goal of improving us
ability, security and speed.
   9. Cryptography A Python library. This exposes cryptographic 
recipes and primitives.
10. Definitions.
   1. "Anaconda Distribution", shortened form "Distribution", is
 an open-source distribution of Python and R programming languag
es for scientific computing and data science. It aims to simplif
y package management and deployment. Anaconda Distribution inclu
des: (1) conda, a package and environment manager for your comma
nd line interface; (2) Anaconda Navigator; (3) 250 automatically
 installed packages; (3) access to the Anaconda Public Repositor
y.
   2. "Anaconda Navigator" means a graphical interface for launc
hing common Python programs without having to use command lines,
 to install packages and manage environments. It also allows the
 user to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, e
nvironments, and channels without using command-line commands.
   3. "Anaconda Public Repository", means the Anaconda packages 
repository of 8000 open-source data science and machine learning
 packages at repo.anaconda.com.

Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda?
This will activate conda on startup and change the command prompt when activated.
If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
   run the following command when conda is activated:

conda config --set auto_activate_base false

You can undo this by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`? [yes|no]
[no] >>> 

You have chosen to not have conda modify your shell scripts at all.
To activate conda's base environment in your current shell session:

eval "$(/home/ian/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.YOUR_SHELL_NAME hook)" 

To install conda's shell functions for easier access, first activate, then:

conda init

Thank you for installing Anaconda3!

An unexpected error has occurred. Conda has prepared the above report.
If you suspect this error is being caused by a malfunctioning plugin,
consider using the --no-plugins option to turn off plugins.

Example: conda --no-plugins install <package>

Alternatively, you can set the CONDA_NO_PLUGINS environment variable on
the command line to run the command without plugins enabled.

Example: CONDA_NO_PLUGINS=true conda install <package>

If submitted, this report will be used by core maintainers to improve
future releases of conda.
Would you like conda to send this report to the core maintainers? [y/N]: y

An unexpected error has occurred. Conda has prepared the above report.
If you suspect this error is being caused by a malfunctioning plugin,
consider using the --no-plugins option to turn off plugins.

Alternatively, you can set the CONDA_NO_PLUGINS environment variable on
the command line to run the command without plugins enabled.

Example: CONDA_NO_PLUGINS=true conda install <package>

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
